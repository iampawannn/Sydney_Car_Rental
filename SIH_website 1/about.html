			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>Sydney Car Rental was founded on May 16, 2024 by Team Kent in Sydney, Australia. Team Kent started with a little bit under ten cars. They started their business in a small office in downtown Sydney. The most challenging days were the company's early days since the team had problem on handling everything from servicing customers to maintaining the vehicles. Their hands-on approach however, ensured the quality of the company. Now, our company is dedicated to providing unparalleled service and quality vehicles for everyone.</p>
